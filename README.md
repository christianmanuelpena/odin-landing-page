# Landing Page Project - The Odin Project
This project showcase my HTML and CSS skills. 

The project gives you a screenshot of a landing page that you have to recreate. 

## Key takeaways
This was great practice to code from what you're seeing visually. 

I worked on the project one section at a time. I would frist created all the HTML elements and the style them using CSS. Once complete, I would commit the changes and publish them.
